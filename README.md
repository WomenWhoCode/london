## How to Run Project Locally

This content is created using GitHub Pages with Jekyll. 

### Prerequisites
Before you can use Jekyll to test a site, you must:

1. Install [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/).
Create a Jekyll site. For more information, see "Creating a GitHub Pages site with Jekyll."
We recommend using Bundler to install and run Jekyll. Bundler manages Ruby gem dependencies, reduces Jekyll build errors, and prevents environment-related bugs. To install Bundler:

2. Install Ruby. For more information, see [Installing Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation/).
   
3. Install Bundler. For more information, see [Bundler](https://bundler.io/)

### Build and run

- Run on terminal `bundle install`

- Run on terminal `bundle exec jekyll serve`

- Access the page on browser: http://127.0.0.1:4000

## How to Run End-To-End Testing Locally

1. Open your Terminal in the `e2e-tests` folder, e.g. `cd ~/workspace/london/e2e-tests`
2. `npm install cypress --save-dev` - This will install Cypress locally as a dev dependency for your project.
3. Run `npx cypress open` from your project root
4. Select E2E testing

![Open Cypress](https://i.ibb.co/4VNPFjf/welcome-cypress.png)

5. Select *E2E testing* option.

6. Choose your browser and click *Start E2E testing in..*..
