  bio: I am a passionate QA Engineer, have experience in testing Web Applications manually and using automation scripts, as well as API Testing (Postman, SOAP UI). I can support my mentees by sharing knowledge and helpful resources. I believe that testing is way more than just finding bugs and flaws, but looking at process and product from the user perspective. Since I am a big fan of exploratory testing, we can also test together during our mentorship sessions! Apart from the technical part I am interested in exploring different aspects in team communication, cross cultural collaboration and volunteering in professional communities!
