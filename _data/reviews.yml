      feedback: Achived my goal. I have been trying to find a place for myself in tech industry since I've made the career decision . The most important thing is never stop belive in yourself and what you capabile of . Keep work hard stuck with your goal and make it happen whatever it takes . When I signed the job contract I was still saying myself like 'did I make it ? I stll can't belive it :) ' This is the most exited thing that I had so far . I wonder what is next :) .
