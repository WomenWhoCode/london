  answer: It is also possible to have meetings in-person if you both are based in the same location. This can be beneficial for people who prefer to have direct personal interactions. In-person mentorship meetings can take place in an office or other location like a cafe, co-working, etc. But only if the mentor and mentee are located in the same city and the mentor is available for an in-person session.
